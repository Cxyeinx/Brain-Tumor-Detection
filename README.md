# Transfer Learning

Transfer learning consists of taking features learned on one problem, and leveraging them on a new, similar problem. For instance, features from a model that has learned to identify trucks may be useful to kick-start a model meant to identify cars.

Transfer learning is usually done for tasks where your dataset has too little data to train a full-scale model from scratch.

The most common incarnation of transfer learning in the context of deep learning is the following worfklow:

1. Take layers from a previously trained model.
2. Freeze them, so as to avoid destroying any of the information they contain during future training rounds.
3. Add some new, trainable layers on top of the frozen layers. They will learn to turn the old features into predictions on a new dataset.
4. Train the new layers on your dataset.

### Fine Tuning
Process of Unfreezing the entire model and going through the dataset with a low learning rate to give a finishing touch for the generalisation. 

This can be helpful for slightly changing the learnt features according to the new dataset.
